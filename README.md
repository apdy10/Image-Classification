# Image-Classification
While execution of Training.py, if there is an AssertionError, change the variable batch_size to a different value that is a factor of the total training images. To change the batch_size in Training.py, go to line number 14 and change the value.

## Steps
1. Install the modules required based on the type of implementation.
2. Download the dataset you want to train and predict your system with. For sample data, you can download the [101_ObjectCategories (131Mbytes)].
3. Construct the folder sub-structure required.
